    <h1>Ashley Lee SWEN 101.04 Github.io Assignment</h1>
    <p>
        Hi, My name is Ashley Lee. I'm from New York City. I was born in China but I moved to New York before I was a year old. I have no brothers or sisters so I'm an only child. I attended Brooklyn Technical High School in Brooklyn, New York City. I'm an only child. I like doing origami as a hobby because it it's easy to access paper and it keeps my hands occupied. I like vegetables more than fruits because I like the crunch of vegetables. A pet peeve of mine are slow walkers because it bothers me when I'm stuck behind someone else and can't walk at the pace I'd like.
